# BerkeleyBikeMap
#### iOS App

BerkeleyBikeMap is a simple iOS app that uses the mapbox ios sdk to display custom tiles. The tiles were made in [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) and are based off the [osm-bright](https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright) template. All of the tiles come from [Open Street Map](http://openstreetmap.org) data.
